# Git_Page_Clone
## A webpage that is a clone of a Github Insights page
This webpage was cloned for learning pupose only.

*Vanila CSS* was used in this project without any css framework like *Bootstrap*.

*Flexbox* and *Grid* System provided the structure to the page which gave independence for customization.

*Vanila CSS* (CSS3) was used instead of any framework to demonstrate same or more amount of flexibility that is provided by *Vanila css*.

**This webpage was designed in dark theme ( *because i love black* )**

> *This clone webpage is not functional and is for demonstration and learning purpose only*.

> Webpage is not responsive for now which means it only supports desktop version only ( future release might include responive code )
